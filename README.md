# Dsa210_project: Coffee Consumption and Sleep Quality Analysis
##  Overview
Understanding personal habits and lifestyle factors can provide valuable insights into daily energy levels and overall well-being. This project aims to analyze my personal coffee consumption and sleep patterns over the past few months, identifying correlations between coffee intake, sleep quality, and daily energy levels. The goal is to explore trends and develop a predictive model estimating sleep quality or energy levels based on coffee consumption.
##  Motivation
Coffee is a major part of my daily routine, and sleep is critical for productivity and health. I drink coffee almost every day, and I want to understand how daily coffee consumption affects my sleep quality and overall well-being. This project investigates whether higher coffee intake or specific timing of coffee consumption influences sleep duration and sleep quality ratings throughout the semester.
## Objectives
- Analyze daily coffee consumption and sleep patterns over several months.
- Identify factors influencing energy levels and sleep quality (like time of coffee intake, day of the week, academic workload, and weather conditions).
- Build a predictive model for sleep quality or energy level based on these factors.
- Apply data science techniques in personal data context.
## Data Collection & Sources
The analysis is conducted using both personal data collected daily and additional influencing factors from external sources:

### Primary Data Source
I will collect my own daily data using Google Sheets or a CSV file.  
Each day, I will record:
- Daily coffee consumption (time, amount)
- Sleep patterns (bedtime, wake-up time, sleep duration, sleep quality)
- Daily energy level (self-reported, scale 1-5)

### External Influencing Factors
- Day of the week (weekend and weekday)
- Academic calender (exam days, assignment deadlines; collected from SabancÄ± University calendar)
- Weather conditions (precipitation from Weather API)
